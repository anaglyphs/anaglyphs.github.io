<h1>How to Play</h1>

<p>Lasertag is a work-in-progress game, so it's pretty bare bones.

<p><b>We recommend only playing on Quest 3 and 3s.</b>
Quest 2 and Pro headsets lack essential spatial understanding features. 
<b>There is no need to scan your space before playing!</b>

<p>To start a game, make sure all of your headsets are on the same WiFi network.
Then, have one person press the 'host game' button. Other headsets in proximity
should connect automatically. School and office networks may not work.

<p>Once everyone connects, you can start shooting at each other! 
<b>Only headshots count!!!</b>

<p>There's an objects menu where you can place team bases, capture points,
walls, and select your gun. Once you place red and blue bases you can state a team
deathmatch that lasts 3 minutes. Future updates will flesh out the match system with
options and other gamemodes.
