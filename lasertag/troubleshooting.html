<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Lasertag is a work-in-progress game, so it isn't a seamless experience.
Meta Quest headsets are also full of quirks that can cause problems. 

<details>
	<summary>My headsets won't connect!</summary>
	<p><b>Your headsets must be on the same WiFi network.</b>
	Meta headsets have a habit of disconnecting from networks when asleep
	or switching to other known networks in the same space.
	
	<p><b>Some WiFi networks won't work.</b>
	Office and school networks often stop devices 
	from talking to each other.
	You may be able to use a phone or Windows PC hotspot, 
	but these have limited range.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>My headsets won't collocate!</summary>
	<p>First, make sure they all have a proper internet connection.
	While Lasertag connects over LAN, collocation unfortunately 
	relies on Meta's cloud services.
	
	<p>Make sure each headset gets a good look at its surroundings. 
	If only some headsets fail, show them around
	the playspace more and try connecting again.
	
	<p>Meta's collocation system isn't the most robust. 
	Sometimes you just need to reboot troublesome headsets.
	Meta service outages can also prevent collocation from working.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>I get a pop-up saying 'you've moved too far!'</summary>
	<p>Meta headsets restrict movement, even in mixed reality, to a certain
	radius from the 'origin' (which is where you either launched the app
	or last re-centered). This radius is ~20 meters.
	
	<p>You can prevent this pop-up by disabling 'physical space features' in the settings app.
	<b>Beware these resulting quirks!</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The system boundary is dangerous disabled in all VR apps!
		<li>Passthrough is disabled in the system home menu.
		<li>Screen recordings won't capture passthrough. You'll just see a black void.
	</ul>
	<p>Once you are done playing Lasertag, or if you wish to capture video,
	make sure to turn this back on!

<details>
	<summary>My video recordings of the game are black!</summary>
	<p>See above. Make sure 'physical space features' are enabled
	when recording video.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>I can shoot through and see people's heads through walls!</summary>
	<p>If you're playing on Quest 3 or 3s, make sure you
	give the app 'spatial data' permission. You may have to grant it
	in system settings.
	
	<p>If you're playing on Quest 2 or Pro, these headsets unfortunately
	lack features necessary to understand and respond to your environment.
