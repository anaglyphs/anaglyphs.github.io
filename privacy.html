<h1>Privacy Policy for Lasertag</h1>
<h3>tl;dr, we don't collect any information. Meta & Unity do.</h3>
<br>
<p>Lasertag does not collect or transmit any personal information (or any information at all)
to anyone except for
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target=_"blank">
Meta</a>,
<a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank">
Unity</a>,
and any people you're playing with.
All Meta Quest apps must typically share some information (such as your User/Device ID, IP address, etc.)
with Meta and Unity.</p>

<p>The multiplayer networking takes place on your local network
and doesn't interface with any third party servers
except for Meta's.</p>

<p>When you join a multiplayer game, your Meta User ID, Device ID, and IP address
are shared with other players, with Meta for colocation functionality,
and with Unity for multiplayer connection functionality.
We do not transmit any data to anybody else.</p>

<p>Information about your physical space (point cloud information and more)
is collected and managed by Meta for colocation functionality.
We don't handle or have access to that data.</p>
