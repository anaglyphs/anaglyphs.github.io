<h1>Privacy Policy for Lasertag</h1>
<h3>tl;dr, we don't collect any information. Meta does.</h3>
<br>
<p>Lasertag does not collect or transmit any personal information (or any information at all)
to anyone except for 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target=_"blank">
Meta</a> and any people you're playing with on your local network. 
All Meta Quest apps must typically share some information (such as your User ID)
with Meta.</p>

<p>The multiplayer networking takes place on your local network
and doesn't interface with any third party servers 
except for Meta's.</p>

<p>When you join a multiplayer game, your Meta User ID is shared with other players
and with Meta for colocation functionality. It is not kept by other players or by anyone else
but Meta after the game session ends.</p>

<p>Information about your physical space (point cloud information and more)
is collected and managed by Meta for colocation functionality.
We don't handle or have access to that data.</p>

<p>You can reach out to triveri@outlook.com if you have any questions</p>
