<h1>Privacy Policy for Lasertag</h1>
<p><b>tl;dr, we collect, but do not save or store, any of your information.
	We transmit bare-essential information (Meta User ID, IP address, Device ID) only to Meta and Unity
	services.</b></p>
<p>Lasertag does not transmit any personal information
to anyone except for
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy" target=_"blank">
Meta</a>,
<a href="https://unity.com/legal/game-player-and-app-user-privacy-policy" target="_blank">
Unity</a>,
and any people you're playing with in the same physical space.
All Meta Quest apps must typically share some information (such as your User/Device ID, IP address, etc.)
with Meta. We use the Unity game engine, which may send telemetry data to Unity according to their
privacy policy.</p>

<p>The multiplayer networking takes place either on your local network
or through Unity's Relay servers. When opting-in to using Unity's Relay servers,
the device will and must send some information
(an anonymous per-session ID & your IP address)
to Unity.
</p>

<p>When you join a multiplayer game, your Meta User ID, Device ID, and IP address
are shared with other players, with Meta for colocation functionality,
and optionally with Unity for multiplayer connection functionality.
We do not transmit any data to anybody else, including to ourselves or our own servers.</p>

<p>Information about your physical space (point cloud information and more)
is collected and managed by Meta for colocation functionality.
We don't handle or have access to that data.</p>

<p>You can reach out to triveri@outlook.com if you have any questions</p>
